# Face-emotion-recognition-app
The python application developed with the use of ML libraries and carefully selected Google face database. Once trained, the model is utilized to analyse live camera image and then cover the key area with emoji associated with the recognized emotion.

PS. This repository will be structured and described in a detail once the developer finds some spare time, hopefully sometime soon.
